Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: that Brazil would win and that Japan would not be last

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After 10000 simulations, because the results stabilize
